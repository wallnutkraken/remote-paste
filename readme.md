# remote-paste

An application that listens to youtube links sent to a telegram bot by the specified user (by username only)
and pastes it into the active window.

# Intent

Originally intended for easily pasting youtube links into VRChat players without getting off the couch.

# Build

Currently, this application only builds on Windows as it uses the win32 keyboard input APIs.

# Why are you using sinks? Why is this so overengineered?

I wanted to play around with them and try to understand them better .-.
